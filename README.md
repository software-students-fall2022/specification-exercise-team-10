## Product Vision Statement

Our app is a user-friendly platform that serves to provide mobile food vendors and customers with the ability to pre-order food to reduce wait-time, help spread awareness of food trucksâ€™ locations and products, and allow the use of online paying services for purchases.

## User Requirements

1. As a customer, I want to get preorder my food at a specific time slot so that I could be more productive with my time.
2. As a customer, I want to pay electronically so that I do not have to get cash.
3. As a customer, I want to see all available food trucks in my area so that I can go to the nearest one.
4. As a customer, I want to log in so that I can check my preorder time.

## Activity Diagrams

- As a mobile food vendor, I want to view the current pending orders from my customers so that I can serve them.
