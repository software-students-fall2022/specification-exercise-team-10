## Stakeholders

[Additional Information](stakeholder-interview)

**Stakeholder Name:** Azim Siddiki

**Goals/Needs:**
1. Letting customers be aware of location changes so that new customers can be served as soon as possible.
2. Increase customer count by minimizing lost customers such as those who don’t want to wait in line, pay with cash, etc.
3. Marketing for potential customers to find the particular vendor online instead of only being able to target customers who are walking by.
4. Encourage returning customers (this could possibly be done with rewards or benefits for returning customers ex: loyalty cards).

**Problems/Frustrations:**
1. Customers may leave the line if they have to wait too long. Note that if the customer makes the order, they are committed and stay since the food is already being prepared.
2. Customers don’t know when the vendor is closed or open as mobile food vendors sometimes have flexible schedules that may depend on factors such as supplies in the truck.
3. Moving to a new location, even nearby, could result in a loss of returning customers who may believe the mobile food vendor is gone.
4. Delivery app services such as Grubhub charge commission and have a more complicated registration process that can be daunting for vendors who may have difficulty with the language. Additionally, smaller mobile vendors can’t cover costs for things like marketing and don’t always have the same address.

## Product Vision Statement

Our app is a user-friendly platform that serves to provide mobile food vendors and customers with the ability to pre-order food to reduce wait-time, help spread awareness of food trucks’ locations and products, and allow the use of online paying services for purchases.

## User Requirements

1. As a customer, I want to get preorder my food at a specific time slot so that I could be more productive with my time.
2. As a customer, I want to pay electronically so that I do not have to get cash.
3. As a customer, I want to see all available mobile food vendors in my area so that I can go to the nearest one.
4. As a customer, I want to log in so that I can check my preorder time.
5. As a customer, I want to see the menu for all the mobile food vendors so that I can see what I want to order.
6. As a customer, I want to see how busy each mobile food vendor is so that I can know how long it would take to get my order.
7. As a mobile food vendor, I want to register my truck on the app so that users can see and order from my truck through the app.
8. As a mobile food vendor, I want to login to the app so that I can access my truck’s details in the app.
9. As a mobile food vendor, I want to show and edit my truck location so that customers can still find me if my truck has to move.
10. As a mobile food vendor, I want to view the current pending orders from my customers so that I can serve them.
11. As a customer, I want to get the reviews of the trucks so that I can taste the best street foods.
