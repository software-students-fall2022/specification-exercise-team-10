Location: 31 St. & Park Ave. Food Truck - Azim Siddiki (Last name?)
(additionally 28 St. between Park Ave. and Lexington Ave. and 30 St. and 1st Ave. with limited responses)

Stakeholder Interview Notes (Paraphrased/Rephrased responses to questions):
More customers is obviously better, but too many at one time may not be good (demand too high, can’t keep up with making food - just one guy in truck)
There is a small number of returning customers (not exactly regulars but they come back). More returning customers would be better but not a huge priority.
If the line is too long, customers sometimes leave without waiting - there is another food truck down the block.
This question was a bit harder to answer/didn’t really get a clear response
Usually close in the evening around 8 but not set.
The most customers come around 4-6pm when most people are getting off work. (Note: there does seem to be a decent population of people getting off work around this time in this area.)
Very rarely
